# Caelestia Tablet Mode

Convertible-laptop support for Caelestia and Hyprland.

The plugin provides:

- tablet-mode state integration for foldable/convertible hardware
- live iio-sensor-proxy auto-rotation through all four orientations (with the raw HID-IIO sysfs path only as a fallback)
- automatic accelerometer rediscovery if the Intel sensor hub disappears and later re-enumerates
- sensor-mount-independent live rotation: the current SensorProxy orientation and screen transform form a relative baseline, so a fixed accelerometer mounting offset does not break rotation
- matching touchscreen and pen transforms
- only the built-in laptop touchpad rotates with the display through a tiny post-libinput Hyprland motion hook; USB/Bluetooth/virtual pointers stay neutral
- an always-split Rotation quick control: **Auto** on the left is a real on/off toggle, while the right side shows **0° / 90° / 180° / -90°** and forces the next 90° step
- an on-screen keyboard and tablet-mode input handling
- optional disabling of physical keyboard/touchpad input while folded

Hardware selection is not tied to a particular laptop model. The runtime discovers the internal display from common internal-panel connector types and uses Hyprland's main-keyboard and touchpad device information instead of vendor-specific input names.

## Touch-friendly bar popouts

Caelestia's status popouts are normally hover-driven. TabletMode adds a
touchscreen-only tap latch for the same bar targets, and it intentionally works
even when the convertible is in normal laptop mode. Tapping Bluetooth, network,
audio, battery, or another bar popout opens the same panel that mouse hover
selects and keeps it open after finger release. Mouse and touchpad hover
semantics remain unchanged.

The integration is owned by scripts/ensure-touch-popouts. It is idempotent,
keeps timestamped shell backups under
~/.local/state/caelestia-tabletmode/shell-backups, and fails closed if a future
Caelestia update changes the expected interaction hooks.

## Compatibility names

The historical helper executable is named `yoga-tablet`, and older installations may have state under `~/.config/yoga-tablet`. Those names are retained for compatibility only; the plugin is not restricted to Lenovo Yoga hardware.

## Configuration

Use the Caelestia Plugins page for rotation thresholds, auto-rotation policy, on-screen keyboard options, and folded-input policy. **Auto rotation scope** has three modes: always follows the live sensor in both laptop and tablet mode, tablet follows it only while folded, and never disables automatic rotation. The Rotation quick control is permanently split: the left side toggles accelerometer-driven rotation on/off without changing the current angle when locking, while each tap on the right side forces the next 90-degree orientation and holds it. Display and touchscreen/pen transforms are updated together. Relative motion from only udev-integrated touchpads is then rotated inside Hyprland after libinput, because many laptop touchpads (including Mirai's ELAN device) expose neither libinput rotation nor a calibration matrix. External USB/Bluetooth/virtual pointers are intentionally excluded. A specific monitor can be selected where automatic internal-panel detection is not suitable.

## Keyboard

TabletMode builds its keyboard from the tracked `vendor/wvkbd` source; no copy
from a cache directory is required. Install it for the current user with:

    ./scripts/build-wvkbd

The normal layer keeps desktop essentials such as Esc, Ctrl, Alt, Super and Tab,
while navigation keys, Insert/Delete and F1-F12 live on the desktop layer. A
compact icon row stays visible for the whole lifetime of the OSK. Its first
button is the only keyboard/desktop-tools layer switcher, followed by clipboard,
emoji, Protocol7 dictation history and voice input. The microphone is an action
rather than a mode, so starting or stopping Protocol7 does not dismiss the
keyboard or replace the current panel. It talks to Protocol7's local control
socket directly (with the Caelestia IPC as a startup fallback), so changing the
user's physical dictation hotkey never changes the toolbar integration.

Keyboard, clipboard, emoji and Protocol7 dictation history form one horizontal
page deck underneath the fixed icon row. Moving right through the toolbar pushes
the current page left while the next page enters from the right; moving back
reverses the motion. The real native wvkbd surface is part of that motion: a
private inherited control pipe drives its layer-shell x offset with the same
230 ms OutCubic curve as the QML pages, so keyboard ↔ clipboard/emoji/history no
longer looks like a static background swap. The transparent pager surface stays
mapped and click-through while the keyboard page is active, which prevents the
compositor from applying a second diagonal layer entrance when a utility page is
selected. wvkbd itself runs on layer-shell `top`, while the resident toolbar
and pager stay on `overlay`; this keeps those controls permanently above the
keyboard without delaying their entrance.

The toolbar's reserved native row uses 0.62 of a normal key-row height. The saved
space is redistributed to the real key rows, keeping the keyboard footprint and
window-resize inset unchanged while making the icon bar visibly tighter. Its
layer surface stays mapped and transparent at the screen bottom while the OSK is
closed; opening the OSK raises that resident surface vertically with the keyboard,
so the toolbar never receives a separate sideways compositor entrance. Vertical
open/close motion now has one authoritative QML clock: its 230 ms OutCubic
motionInset value positions the toolbar and grab handle directly and is streamed
frame-for-frame over a private mode-0600 Unix socket to the daemon, which applies
the matching native wvkbd y offset. There is no second toolbar/native timer to
drift. Toolbar grey pills are pointer-hover previews only
(mouse/touchpad/stylus); touch taps select immediately and the underline alone
represents the active mode.
Clipboard history is searchable and uses `cliphist`;
dictation history reads Protocol7's existing
`~/.config/protocol-7/history.json` rather than creating another database. The
emoji browser searches the local Noctalia emoji catalogue (currently 1,913
entries), exposes category filters and loads additional pages while scrolling.
Each search field has its own touch keyboard, so filtering does not require a
physical keyboard. Clipboard and history text are passed only through argv/stdin
helpers and are never evaluated as shell commands.

Glide typing records the actual touch trajectory instead of merely collecting
the keys crossed by the finger. wvkbd draws a continuous anti-aliased trail and
sends a bounded `(x, y, time)` trace plus the live key-centre geometry to an
asynchronous decoder. The decoder uniformly resamples the path, creates ideal
word traces from the current keyboard geometry, prunes by start/end anchors and
combines shape, location, path-length, corner/order and repeated-letter evidence.
This is an original compact implementation informed by the SHARK2 family and the
open geometric architecture used by CleverKeys; it does not depend on Android or
a proprietary swipe library. German and English use local hunspell dictionaries
when present and fall back to the tracked compact lexicon. Long-press alternates
and primary-touch ownership remain active.

## Legacy helper commands

Existing integrations can continue using:

    yoga-tablet status
    yoga-tablet toggle-lock
    yoga-tablet rotate next
    yoga-tablet osk toggle

These are compatibility entry points to the plugin-owned runtime.

## Hyprland layer integration

Horizontal native-keyboard paging is hard-clipped at the same left boundary as
the QML utility pager. The patched wvkbd keeps its Wayland layer surface at a
constant full size and animates a Cairo snapshot inside that fixed surface.
Pixels moving past the surface's left edge are naturally clipped, while Hyprland
never receives a reduced keyboard width. Returning to the keyboard destroys the
snapshot and redraws the live layout, preventing tiny or blank keyboard states.

On Hyprland, keeping the wvkbd layer rule at no_anim = true, order = -10 is
also recommended. The negative order keeps the native surface behind Caelestia's
other top-layer surfaces, while the hard clip prevents transparent shell regions
from revealing keyboard pixels during a page transition.
